## About The Project

This repo exists as my submission for the Suade Labs Python Challange 2022. Once submitted and received, it will most likely go private for privacy reasons. The challange itself is found in the next section.

<!-- The Challange -->

## The Challange

We are expecting you to deliver your work as a git project, with a README file containing instructions on how to install/run the project.

You should use python 3 and a web framework of your choice, we use Flask but it is okay to use something else.

You will find an archive here https://updates.suade.org/files/data.zip that contains sample data from an imaginary e-shop.

Your task is to create an endpoint that, for a given date, will return a report that will contain the following metrics:

<br>

– The total number of items sold on that day.

– The total number of customers that made an order that day.

– The total amount of discount given that day.

– The average discount rate applied to the items sold that day.

– The average order total for that day

– The total amount of commissions generated that day.

– The average amount of commissions per order for that day.

– The total amount of commissions earned per promotion that day.
